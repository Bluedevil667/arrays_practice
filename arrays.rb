#Arrays practice
array = ["jake","beth","katelyn","wyatt"]
array_2 = [5,10,15,20]
array_3 = [5.5,10.5,15.5,20.5]
array_4 = [true,true,false,false]

#When calling on these arrays, the first item in each array will always be 0, in order to call on the 4th item in the array, you would need to actually write `3` in the code in order to get the desired reponse.

puts array
puts array_2[2]
puts array_3[0]
puts array_4[3]
